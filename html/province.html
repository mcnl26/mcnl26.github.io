                <p>Camarines Norte (Central Bikol: Amihanan na Camarines; Tagalog: Hilagang Camarines) is a province in the Philippines located in the Bicol Region in Luzon. Its capital is Daet. The province borders Quezon to the west, Camarines Sur to the south, and the Philippine Sea to the north. It has historically been a Bikol speaking region, however there has been a language shift in recent years to Tagalog which is more commonly used nowadays.</p>
                <p>The Rizal Monument in Daet, Camarines Norte was the first monument built to honor Jos√© Rizal, and is the oldest surviving such monument in the Philippines. It was designed by Lt. Colonel Antonio Sanz with the help of Ildefonso Alegre of the Philippine Revolutionary Army and through the financial contributions of the locals of Camarines Norte.[1] The three-tiered stone pylon with its square base supporting a triangle in two stages was the first monument and memorial marker in memory of the Philippines' National Hero.[2]</p>
